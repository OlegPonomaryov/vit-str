# Vision Transfomer for Scene Text Recognition
<p>
This project aims to explore application of the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture for Scene Text Recognition problems. The model is implemented with Tensorflow 2 and is similar to the original ViT with some changes to fit the new type of problem:
